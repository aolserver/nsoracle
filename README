This directory contains release 2.7 of an Oracle driver for AOLserver. For
info, or the lastest version, see http://www.arsdigita.com/.

It was written by Cotton Seed (cottons@lcs.mit.edu), later modifications
by Mark Dalrymple (markd@arsdigita.com), Jin Choi (jsc@arsdigita.com),
and Rob Mayoff (mayoff@arsdigita.com).

This Oracle driver is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License, as
published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2, or (at your
option) any later version.

* Be sure to explicitly load the nsdb.so module when running this module under
* AOLserver 4.x!

How to Build:

* Requires GNU Make (available from the GNU project at
  http://www.gnu.org.  It is usually called "make-*.tar.gz" on the GNU ftp
  sites)

* Set ORACLE_HOME in your environment.

* Edit the Makefile and set NSHOME to the location of your AOLserver
  source or binary tree.

* Run "make" or "gmake" (whichever is GNU Make).

* Run "make install" or copy "nsoracle.so" and "nsoraclecass.so" to your
  AOLserver bin directory.  "nsoraclecass.so" is the Cassandracle Oracle
  driver; it only permits SELECT statements.

NOTES:

   The "how-to write an AOLserver driver" docs are at
   http://www.aolserver.com/server/docs/2.3/html/dr-app.htm

   The Oracle OCI docs are in Programmer's Guide to the Oracle Call Interface
   http://oradoc.photo.net/ora8doc/DOC/server803/A54656_01/toc.htm

   The documentation for this driver (including a couple of special Tcl API
   calls) is at http://www.arsdigita.com/free-tools/oracle-driver.html

   Config paramters in [ns/db/driver/drivername]:

     Debug: boolean (Defaults to off)
        Enable the "log" call so that lots of stuff gets sent to the
        server.log.

     MaxStringLogLength: integer (defaults to 1024); -1 implies unlimited
        how much character data to log before just saying [too long]

     CharExpansion: integer defaulting to 1
        Factor by which byte representation of character strings can expand
        when fetched from the database.  Should only be necessary to set this
        if your Oracle is not using UTF-8, in which case a value of 2 should
        work for any ISO-8859 character set.
   
   ns_ora clob_dml SQL is logged when verbose=on in the pool's configuration
   section.

   To make a "safe" driver (say for servers running with DBA priviliges) that
   only allows SELECT statements, define FOR_CASSANDRACLE when compiling this
