Building the Oracle driver for Win32
--------------------------------------

This directory contains a Visual Studio workspace for building the
AOLserver Oracle driver for the Win32 platform.  It has been built and
tested on Windows 98 but should build and run on Windows NT 4.0 and
Windows 2000.


How to build
-------------

First make sure that you have the ORACLE_HOME and NS_HOME environment
variables set correctly.  On Windows 98, you set environment variables
in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file. (You'll have to restart your system to make
them visible to applications.)  On Windows NT, you can set environment
variables in the Environment tab in the System control panel.

The ORACLE_HOME variable might not be set automatically by the Oracle
installation.  On Windows 98, it's typically "C:\orawin95" by default
and on Windows NT it's usually "C:\orant".

Be sure to set NS_HOME to the root of your AOLserver build directory,
not the install directory.  The Oracle driver needs to link against
the AOLserver lib files that are only found in the build tree.  You
must build AOLserver before building the Oracle driver.

Now you can open the oracle.dsw file in Visual Studio and build the
project.  Copy the resulting ora8.dll file to your AOLserver bin
directory and load it just as you would load ora8.so on UNIX.
