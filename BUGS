Known Bugs

1. The cleanup after errors after stream_write_lob is very heavy-handed, and
should be fixed to use a better cleanup after interrupting a multipart LOB get.

2. LONGs greater than 1024 bytes aren't supported since we don't do the
piecewise fetch stuff.  Oracle's deprecating LONGs anyway, so we don't want to
burn the time to Do It Right.  We still want to keep them around since the Data
Dictionary returns some stuff as longs.

3. Leaves behind zombie processes on HP-UX 10.xx after conn is closed, due to
lossage with AOLServer and the HP-UX signal handling

4. It may be the case that the Oracle libraries are able to lock the whole
server for moments and keep other AOLserver threads (even those that are just
serving static files and don't even have Tcl interpreters) from serving; this
driver never explicitly takes a lock (see http://db.photo.net/dating/ for an
example of Oracle + JPEG service conflicting).
