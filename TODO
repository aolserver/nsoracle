TODO for nsoracle:

Things marked with * are basically finished.

nsoracle 2.8 release:
*   - Migrate code to Tcl_Objs.
*   - Integrate PL/SQL wrapper support.
    - Update documentation, possibly use DocBook.
    - Improve handling of options (just -bind right now).
    - Update test framework.

nsoracle 3.0 release:
    - Add batch error processing to array dml.
    - Add ability to execute multiple statements on a single db handle.
    - Add ability to use Oracle 9i's scrollable cursors.
    - Improve handling of PL/SQL datatypes, if possible.
    - Replace exec_plsql and exec_plsql_bind with new plsql command.
    - Split OracleSelectObjCommand out. Currently its arraydml, dml, select,
      0or1row, and 1row.
    - Replace blob_*|clob_* commands with clob|blob command with options.

      I think this change might facilitate a cleaner code base, if not then
      its not really necessary because it will break the API.

      Example:

      ns_ora dml <db> -clobfile <files> <sql>
      ns_ora dml <db> -clob ?<lobs>? <sql> ?clob_value? ...

    - Remove array_dml command in favor of -arraydml option to dml command.
