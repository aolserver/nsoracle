2004-02-11  Jeremy Collins <jeremy.collins@tclsource.org>

    * nsoracle.c: Removed duplicate flush_handle code.  Moved
    some pre-AOLserver 3.x code into #ifdef with rest of pre-AS 3.x
    code.

    Cleaned up code to conform to AOLserver engineering standards.

    * nsoracle.h: Added.  

    * version.h: Removed.  Define was moved to nsoracle.h.

2004-02-09  Jeremy Collins <jeremy.collins@tclsource.org>

    * nsoracle.c: Lots of code cleanup.  Split out subcommands into
    separate functions.  Now uses Tcl 8.x Tcl_Objs.

    Two new commands:

        ns_ora plsql
        ns_ora desc

    * plsql.tcl: PL/SQL integration Tcl code from Lee Teague.

    * doc/plsql.txt:  First cut of PL/SQL documentation from Lee Teague.

2004-02-09  Scott S. Goodwin  <scott@scottg.net>

    * Release: nsoracle 2.7

2004-02-08  Jeremy Collins <jeremy.collins@tclsource.org>

    * Makefile: Added LDFLAGS, and LIBS variables back to
    link line so that the driver will compile on Mac OS X.

    Added a check to see if we are compiling against AOLserver 4.x
    and if so add -lnsdb to link line.

    * doc/oracle-driver.html: Reformatted HTML using a nifty
    new stylesheet.  Also cleaned up some of the wording.  Removed
    old links and updated config section to use AS 3.x/4.x style
    config.

2004-02-06  Scott S. Goodwin  <scott@scottg.net>

    * version.h: changed version string from ORA8_DRIVER_VERSION to
    NSORACLE_VERSION and incremented from 2.6 to 2.7.

    * ora8.c, nsoracle.c: rename ora8.c to nsoracle.c; altered Makefile to
    conform. This means you'll need to change your nsd.tcl file to load
    nsoracle.so instead of ora8.so.

    * ChangeLog: I've moved change notes I found in the README and the
    doc/oracle-driver.html files to the end of this ChangeLog.
    
    * BUGS: added and moved bug info from README into here.

    * Makefile, makefile-80: Removed makefile-80; Jeremy Collins worked the
    Makefile to be more responsive and try to determine whether it needs to
    compile against Oracle 8 or 9 libraries.

2002-12-13  Scott S. Goodwin  <scott@scottg.net>

	* Makefile: Added 'make help' and 'make tag' targets.

2002-11-14   Scott S. Goodwin  <scott@scottg.net>

    * Release 2.6: 
    
    Fix buffer size for RAW columns.  Thanks Mike Linksvayer
    <ml@gondwanaland.com>.
    
    Added CharExpansion parameter. Thanks Tomasz Kosiak <tkosiak@arena.pl>.

2002-10-09  Scott S. Goodwin  <scott@scottg.net>

	* Makefile: Added 'file-release' target. This target will
	automatically check out the tag version you give it and package it
	into a file release. Stolen from Rob Mayoff's nscache
	Makefile. Use it like this:

	    make file-release VER=2.4

	* ora8.c: Jeff Davis applied patch 620469, by Matthew Krenzer.

2002-10-03  Scott S. Goodwin  <scott@scottg.net>

	* all: Applied nsora 2.7 (only the ora8.c file). Tagged as
	v2_7beta1.

	* all: Applied nsora 2.6. Tagged as v2_6.

	* all: Applied nsora 2.5. Tagged as v2_5.

	* all: Applied nsora 2.4 and committed.

	* ChangeLog: Added. This initial import is from nsora 2.3. The
	module's name is nsoracle. Tagged as v2_3.

2001-01-17   Unknown

    * Release 2.5: 

    Fix spurious frees in exec_plsql_bind when there were undefined bind
    varaibles.

    Fix frees lob_dml_bind_cmd which should have freed lob_argv rather than
    argv.

    Fix free of fetchbuf->array_values (should use Tcl_Free when allocation is
    by Tcl_SplitList).

    Added support for oracle LONGs of greater than 1024 bytes.

    Added support for setting prefetchrows and prefetchmemory to improve
    throughput on nonlocal oracle connections (by davis@arsdigita.com).

2000-10-12   Unknown

    * Release 2.4:
    
    Make LOB buffer size a configuration parameter so we can work around
    mysterious ORA-24812 bug.
    
    Set parameter LobBufferSize in ns/db/driver/ora to the desired buffer
    size.

2000-09-11   Unknown

    * Release 2.3:

	New Makefile based on AOLserver 3 Makefiles.

	Beginnings of a code reorganization.

	Eliminated a tiny memory leak in the [bc]lob_dml* commands.

2000-07-28   Unknown

    * Release 2.2:

    Fixed a problem with EPIPE handling in stream_write_lob (Contributed by
    Paul Laferriere).

    Fixed a problem with handling UTF-8 data in LOBs (Contributed by Jin
    Choi).

    Added clob_dml_bind, clob_dml_file_bind, blob_dml_bind,
    blob_dml_file_bind, exec_plsql_bind functions.

2000-05-01 Unknown

    * Release 2.1: 
    
    Plugged some potential buffer overflow situations when reporting errors.

    Added bind variable support.

    The error message for certain SQL errors now indicates the location in the
    SQL of the error (contributed by H.B. Weinberg).

    You can now use ns_dberrorcode to get the numeric Oracle error code after
    an error.

    We no longer put huge arrays on the stack, so you shouldn't need to turn
    up your AOLserver stack size so much any more.

    Fixed some memory-allocation problems in bind variable support (we were
    not calling Ns_StrDup in all the right places).

    Expanded bind-variable support.

    Added array DML.

    Fixed bug when reading partial LOBs.

    Added support for building on Win32 platforms.

2000-01-14   Unknown

    * Release 2.0.1: Fixed linking problem on Linux and AOLserver 3 (fstat
    wasn't being linked in with AOLserver 3, so wasn't being found when the
    driver was loaded).

2000-01-06   Unknown

    * Release 2.0:
    
    Fixed error where *lob_get_file would leave temporary files in /var/tmp.

    Optimized *lob_get_file to return directly to the connection rather than
    spooling from the file system.

    It's now easier to see what version of the driver you are running.

    Perform a "strings ora8.so | grep ArsDigita" to get the version number.

    Fixed ora_open_db to return a better error than "NULL Connection" if it
    fails to connect to Oracle.

    Fixed a number of errors found by Jin Choi (jsc@arsdigita.com).

    Added cleanup if the oracle process dies unexpectedly (which would
    ultimately lead to the "hostdef extension doesn't exist" error).

    Added cleanup of the oracle process if a "too many oracle processes"
    (ORA-00020) or "oracle not available" (ORA-01034) error occurs.

    Added in re-implementations of some functions that were removed from
    AOLserver 3.0 but are needed by ACS.

    The oracle 8.1.X makefile is now the default makefile.  If you're still
    using Oracle 8.0.X, you'll need to use the makefile-80: gmake -f
    makefile-80.

1999-06-11   Unknown

    * Release 1.0.3: Turned OCI_SUCCESS_WITH_INFO into a non-error condition.
    Oracle changed behavior between 8.0.X and 8.1.X, causing the use of
    aggregate functions with NULLs to generate a warning.  Since NULLs in
    aggregates usually aren't a problem, we recommend upgrading to this
    version from 1.0.2

1999-04-14   Unknown

    * Release 1.0.2: 
    
    Now printing Oracle's warning messages when a result code of
    OCI_SUCCESS_WITH_INFO is returned (which can happen in cases like having
    NULL values in aggregate functions).

    Added an experimental makefile for building against Oracle 8.1 The syntax
    to use is gmake -f makefile-8.1.

1999-04-05   Unknown

    * Release 1.0.1: Fixed ns_ora clob_get_file so it won't leak open files
    (fix donated by Igor Baikalov - thanks!).

1999-03-12   Unknown

    * Release 1.0:

    Fixed corrupted return data for LONG columns < 1024 bytes.  LONG columns
    over 1024 bytes are not supported.

    Fixed complaint when inserting an empty string via clob_dml.  It now
    inserts a NULL value in this case

    Added clob_dml_file and clob_get_file commands

    Added write_clob command

    Added blob versions of all of the clob commands 

    Added safety features for <a
    href="http://arsdigita.com/free-tools/cassandracle.html">Cassandracle</a> 

    Added the debug configuration parameter, so now getting trace output
    doesn't require recompiling the driver

    clob_dml SQL and the CLOB contents are now logged to the server.log when
    verbose=on is set in the pool's configuration

    Rewrote makefiles so the same makefile works on Solaris, HP-UX 11.00, and
    Linux

1999-01-13   Unknown

    * Release 0.6: Comments and fix for truncation of NUMBER values error.

1997-06-01   Unknown (Cotton Seed?)

    * First release.
