<h2>Oracle Driver</h2>

part of the <a href="/services.html">ArsDigita services section</a>

<b>Note</b>: If you are running version 1.0.2 of the Oracle driver, it
is <strong>strongly recommended</strong> that you upgrade to at least version
2.1 to prevent unexpected error conditions.  (See
<a href="#Version History">Version History</a> or the README for more details.)

<p>

This product lets you use our favorite Web server, AOLserver, with
the Oracle RDBMS.  If you want to see whether it works, use 
the database-backed services at <a
href="http://photo.net/photo/">photo.net</a>.  This is backed by Oracle
8 and handles several queries/second at all times.

<p>

Our driver is free but making it work requires some C and Unix
expertise.  Basically you have to have all the right Oracle libraries on
the computer where you are running AOLserver.  In practice, we install
the complete Oracle RDBMS on the same machine as AOLserver and then all
the right stuff is there.  Anyway, then you have to compile the driver
and make sure that AOLserver runs with the right environment variables
set.  If this all sounds too hard, then you can hire us to install
it on your machine and support you for one year.

<h3>Support for special Oracle features</h3>

<h4>Transactions</h4>

Like all decent database products, Oracle supports transactions (a
number of inserts, deletes, and updates that happen as a unit, or not
at all).  Check out the <a
href="http://arsdigita.com/books/sql/transactions.html">Transactions</a> chapter
of <a href="http://arsdigita.com/books/sql/">SQL for Web Nerds</a> for details on
the concept.

<p>

To support transactions in the Oracle driver, we hijack
<code>ns_db&nbsp;dml</code> and add three new commands:
<ul>
    <li> <b><code>begin transaction</code></b> - DML statements after this one 
         are now within a transaction
    <li> <b><code>end transaction</code></b> - commit the changes made during the
         transaction
    <li> <b><code>abort transaction</code></b> - roll back the transaction.  Any
         DML statements made since the <code>begin transaction</code>
         will be undone, as if they never happened.
</ul>

For example:

<blockquote><pre>
ns_db dml $db "begin transaction"
ns_db dml $db "insert into users (user_id, email) values (1234, 'markd@arsdigita.com')"
ns_db dml $db "update user_contact_info set aim_name='alex samoyed' where user_id=2342"
ns_db dml $db "delete from user_group_map where group_id=55"
ns_db dml $db "end transaction"
</pre></blockquote>

This will affect the contents of three tables once the
<code>end&nbsp;transaction</code> statement is executed.

<p>

You can combine Tcl <code>catch</code> statements and transaction control:

<blockquote><pre>
ns_db dml $db "begin transaction"

if [catch { ns_db dml $db "insert into ..." 
            ns_db dml $db "update ..." 
	    ns_db dml $db "end transaction" } errmsg] {
    ns_db dml $db "abort transaction"
    # perhaps write an error back to the user
    return
} else {
    # tell the user the transaction was successful
}
</pre></blockquote>

This will roll back the transaction if an error happened during the
processing of the insert and update.  If they finished succesfully,
commit the transaction.

<p>

In the event of problems you should explicitly abort the transaction
rather than letting the page exit do the rollback.  If you check for
anything that was done in the first (successful) part of the
transaction, it will give the NEW value. In the following example, a
situation where the first insert worked but the second failed. The
'double-click' check of getting the group count, causing the script to
try the redirect - only to find there actually is no group number
because moving off the current page rolled back the creation of the
group.

<blockquote><pre>
if [catch { ns_db dml $db "begin transaction"
            ns_db dml $db $insert_for_user_groups
            if [info exists insert_for_helper_table] {
                ns_db dml $db $insert_for_helper_table
            } else {
                set $insert_for_helper_table ""
            }
            ns_db dml $db "end transaction" } errmsg] {
                # something went wrong
		# !!! note that this count(*) is picking up the group
		# !!! inserted inside of the transaction
                if { [database_to_tcl_string $db "select count(*) from user_gr\
oups where group_id = $group_id"] > 0 } {
                    # group was already in database
                    ns_returnredirect "group.tcl?group_id=$group_id"
</pre></blockquote>

<p>

Inserting an "abort transaction" call before the if statement fixed
this.

<p>

Note that only DML statements (insert, update, delete) are affected by
transactions.  DDL statements (create table, etc.) are <b>not</b> affected
by transactions.  You can't roll back a table creation; to leave the
database in a consistant state after a failed transaction, you
must wrap the transaction in a "catch" that explicitly drops
the table upon error.

<h4>CLOBs and BLOBs</h4>

Oracle lets you have character columns with up to 2 GB of data.  But
their SQL parser can only handle string literals up to 4000 characters
long.  So we have some special calls for stuffing long strings into
columns of type CLOB, and for stuffing the contents of files into
columns of type CLOB or BLOB.

<p>

<blockquote><pre>
ns_ora clob_dml db query clob_value_1 clob_value_2 ... clob_value_N
</pre></blockquote>

The query must insert or update empty CLOBs into CLOB columns and
return those columns into bind variables using RETURNING (but see
below for an alternate way to use bind variables with the clob_* and blob_*
commands).  The Oracle function "empty_clob()" returns an empty CLOB.
The clob_dml command inserts the Nth clob_value into the Nth bind
variable.  The bind variable names are not significant.  Note that you
don't have to escape apostrophes in the clob values.  For example,

<blockquote><pre>
create table messages (
    message_id	integer primary key,
    subject     varchar(200),
    body        clob
);

ns_ora clob_dml $db "insert into messages (message_id, subject, body)
values (34, 'This is a test', empty_clob())
returning body into :1" "Here's a long body ... to test clob inserts"
</pre></blockquote>

This would insert a new row into the table messages with message_id 34,
subject "This is a test" and body "Here's a long ... clob inserts".
The clob_dml command also works with updates.

<blockquote><pre>
create table personal_ads (
    person_id		integer primary key,
    self_desc	        clob,
    bondage_story	clob,
    perfect_mate_desc	clob
);

ns_ora clob_dml $db "update personal_ads 
set self_desc = empty_clob(), 
    bondage_story = empty_clob(),
    perfect_mate_desc = empty_clob()
where person_id = 96
returning self_desc, bondage_story, perfect_mate_desc
into :one, :two, :three" $new_self_desc $new_bondage_story $new_perfect_mate_desc
</pre></blockquote>

This updates the row where person_id = 96, setting the three CLOB
columns to the values of the tcl variables $new_self_desc,
$new_bondage_story, $new_perfect_mate_desc.  If there were multiple rows
with person_id = 96, each row is updated with the new CLOB values.

<p>

Inserting the contents of files into CLOBs or BLOBs is similar to the
use of the clob_dml command.  (Note that you can use <a href=
"http://www.aolserver.com/server/docs/2.3/html/tapi-c88.htm">
ns_queryget</a> to get the file name of data uploaded via multipart
formdata.  You will probabily also want to view 
<a
href="http://wimpy.arsdigita.com/public/presentation-top.adp?presentation_id=7042&user_id=561">this
lecture by Philip Greenspun on how to do file upload with AOLserver</a>.)

<blockquote><pre>
create table music_archive (
    album_id        integer primary key,
    title           varchar(200),
    mp3             blob
);

ns_ora blob_dml_file $db "insert into music_archive (album_id, title, mp3)
values (42, 'Old Skull''s Greatest Hits', empty_blob())
returning mp3 into :1" /net/downloads/getoutofschool.mp3
</pre></blockquote>

But here, instead of supplying a string to insert into the column,
you're specifying the path to a file.  The Oracle driver will read the
contents of the file and insert it into the database.  Why have this
seperate mechanism?  AOLserver uses Tcl 7.4 which can't handle
embedded null-characters in its variables, so there's no way through
the Tcl API to read a binary file without the data getting munged.



<blockquote><pre>
ns_ora blob_dml_file $db "update music_archive
set mp3 = empty_blob()
where album_id = 42
returning mp3 into :1" /tmp/barrymanilow.mp3
</pre></blockquote>

This updates the row where album_id = 42, setting the BLOB column
to the contents of /tmp/barrymanilow.mp3.  If there were multiple rows with
album_id = 42, each row is updated with the new BLOB value.



<blockquote><pre>
ns_ora blob_get_file $db "select mp3 from music_archive
where album_id = 42" /tmp/something.mp3
</pre></blockquote>

This writes the result of the query, which should return only one column
from one row, into /tmp/something.mp3.

<blockquote><pre>
ns_ora write_blob $db "select mp3 from music_archive
where album_id = 42"
</pre></blockquote>

This returns the contents of the <code>mp3</code> column to the
connection.  Note that you must first write appropriate headers, e.g., 

<blockquote><pre>
ReturnHeaders audio/mpeg
ns_ora write_blob $db "select mp3 ..."
</pre></blockquote>

<code>ReturnHeaders</code> is defined in the standard 
ArsDigita utlities.tcl file, available from 
<a href="http://arsdigita.com/books/panda/utilities.txt">http://arsdigita.com/books/panda/utilities.txt</a>.

<h4>Calling PL/SQL Functions</h4>

You can call PL/SQL functions as normal dml statements.  For example,

<blockquote><pre>
ns_db dml $db "declare begin bboard_update_index_column('$new_id'); end;"
</pre></blockquote>

To execute a PL/SQL function that returns a value, select it from table
dual.  For example,

<blockquote><pre>
ns_db select $db "select get_member_id('Joe', 'Smith') from dual"
</pre></blockquote>

But this will not work if the PL/SQL function has side effects (inserts
or updates).  When the PL/SQL function has side effects, you must use
the ns_ora exec_plsql command.

<blockquote><pre>
ns_ora exec_plsql $db "begin :1 := get_new_member_id('Cotton', 'Seed'); end;"
</pre></blockquote>

The ns_ora exec_plsql command returns the value of the first bind
variable in the PL/SQL statement.  The name of the bind variable is not
significant.


<h4>Bind variables</h4>

To support using bind variables, we provide some additional ns_ora calls.
<ul>
<li>ns_ora select <i>dbhandle ?-bind set? sql ?arg1 ... argn?</i>
<li>ns_ora 0or1row <i>dbhandle ?-bind set? sql ?arg1 ... argn?</i>
<li>ns_ora 1row <i>dbhandle ?-bind set? sql ?arg1 ... argn?</i>
<li>ns_ora dml <i>dbhandle ?-bind set? sql ?arg1 ... argn?</i>
<li>ns_ora array_dml <i>dbhandle ?-bind set? sql ?arg1 ... argn?</i>
<li>ns_ora clob_dml_bind <i>dbhandle sql list_of_lob_vars ?clob_value_1 clob_value_2 ... clob_value_N?</i>
<li>ns_ora blob_dml_bind <i>dbhandle sql list_of_lob_vars ?clob_value_1 clob_value_2 ... clob_value_N?</i>
<li>ns_ora clob_dml_file_bind <i>dbhandle sql list_of_lob_vars ?clob_value_1 clob_value_2 ... clob_value_N?</i>
<li>ns_ora blob_dml_file_bind <i>dbhandle sql list_of_lob_vars ?clob_value_1 clob_value_2 ... clob_value_N?</i>
<li>ns_ora exec_plsql_bind <i>dbhandle sql return_var ?arg1 ... argn?</i>
</ul>

<p> With the exception of the four <code>lob_dml</code> calls
and <code>exec_plsql_bind</code>, these work the
same as the corresponding ns_db calls, except that you can use bind
variables in your SQL.  There are three ways to specify the bind
variables: <ul>
  <li>As positional parameters, e.g. ":1".  The value for the bind
  variable is taken from the arguments after the SQL argument in
  order.  ":1" is the first argument after the SQL, ":2" is the
  second, and so on.
  <li>As Tcl variable values, e.g. ":min_value".  The value for the
  bind variable is taken from the local Tcl environment, so in this
  example it would be the value of the variable "min_value".
  <li>As elements of an ns_set, e.g., ":min_value" (only if the
  <tt>-bind</tt> argument is specified). The value for the
  bind variable is the element named "min_value" in the set
  with ID <i>set</i>.
</ul>

Examples:

<blockquote><pre>
ns_ora dml $db "update users set last_name = :1
    where user_id = :2" "Gates" $user_id

set values [ns_set create]
ns_set put $values last_name "Gates"
ns_set put $values user_id   $user_id
ns_ora dml $db -bind $values "update users set last_name = :last_name
    where user_id = :user_id"    

set user_email "billg@microsoft.com"
set selection [ns_ora 0or1row $db "select first_names,
    last_name from users where email = :user_email"]
</pre></blockquote>

With <code>clob_dml_bind</code>,
<code>blob_dml_bind</code>,
<code>clob_dml_file_bind</code>
and
<code>blob_dml_file_bind</code>, an extra argument is required.
The <code>list_of_lob_vars</code> argument is a list of bind
variables that represent LOB arguments.  This is required because
there is no way to tell in advance from examining the SQL or the Tcl
variables which arguments are a LOB type,
yet Oracle requires the driver to specify the LOB type of the
arguments before executing the SQL.  The solution is for the
programmer to pass that information in along with the variables.

Examples:

<blockquote><pre>
ns_ora clob_dml_bind $db "update manuscripts set text = :1
    where manuscript_id = :2" [list 1] $gettysburg_address $man_id

set gettysburg_address "Four score and seven years ago"
set man_id 1861
ns_ora clob_dml_bind $db "update manuscripts set text = :gettysburg_address
    where manuscript_id = :man_id" [list gettysburg_address]
</pre></blockquote>

The <code>exec_plsql_bind</code> call has a similar problem: it needs
to be told which bind variable is the return value of the function.
The value of the bind variable named in the <code>return_var</code>
argument will be returned as the value of the
<code>exec_plsql_bind</code> call.  If it is a named variable and not
a positional variable, then the variable's value will also be set.

Examples:

<blockquote><pre>
ns_ora exec_plsql_bind $db "begin :1 := translate_to_german('Four score'); end;" 1

set english "Four score and seven years ago"
ns_ora exec_plsql_bind $db "begin :deutsch := translate_to_german(:english); end;" deutsch
</pre></blockquote>

<h4>Array DML</h4>

Array DML works exactly like single-row DML, except that the statement
is executed multiple times with distinct data sets. This is useful
when inserting many similarly-structured items into the database.
To use array DML, set the value of each bind variable to be a <i>list</i>
rather than a single value, e.g.:

<blockquote><pre>set last_names [list Gates Ellison Jobs]
set first_names [list Bill Larry Steve]
set user_ids [list 666 816 1984]

ns_ora array_dml $db "
    update users
    set last_name = :last_names, first_name = :first_names
    where user_id = :user_ids
"

# Or, equivalently:

ns_ora array_dml $db "
    update users
    set last_name = :1, first_name = :2
    where user_id = :3
" $last_names $first_names $user_ids

# Or, equivalently:

ns_set values [ns_set create]
ns_set put $values last_names $last_names
ns_set put $values first_names $first_names
ns_set put $values user_ids $user_ids
ns_ora array_dml $db -bind $values "
    update users
    set last_name = :last_names, first_name = :first_names
    where user_id = :user_ids
"</pre></blockquote>

Note that the statement is prepared (i.e., parsed) by Oracle only once,
so there is much less overhead and far fewer round trips to the server.

<h3>Extra AOLserver Tcl API calls</h3>

AOLserver does not provide an ns_db abstraction for some things that it
should.  Consequently, when talking to Illustra, they have ns_ill
calls.  We were forced to provide ns_ora calls.  Here they are...

<ul>

<li>ns_ora resultid <i>dbhandle</i> -- returns the rowid (Oracle hidden
column) of the last object affected by a DML command. This rowid can be
used to determine the rowid for a newly-inserted row. Note that this is
currently not implemented.
<br><br>

<li>ns_ora resultrows <i>dbhandle</i> -- returns the number of rows
affected by the last DML command. It can be used to determine how many
rows were deleted or updated.
<br><br>

<li>ns_ora exec_plsql <i>dbhandle sql</i> -- executes the given
PL/SQL statement, returing the value of the first bind variable in the
statement.
<br><br>

<li>ns_ora clob_dml <i>dbhandle sql clob_value_1 ?clob_value 2 ...
clob_value_N?</i>
<li>ns_ora blob_dml <i>dbhandle sql blob_value_1 ?blob_value 2 ...
blob_value_N?</i><br>
Evaluates the given sql statement, inserting the the given values 
into the columns specified by the bind variables referenced.
<br><br>

<li>ns_ora clob_dml_file <i>dbhandle sql path1 ?path2 ... pathN?</i>
<li>ns_ora blob_dml_file <i>dbhandle sql path1 ?path2 ... pathN?</i><br>
Evaluates the given sql statement, inserting the contents of the
given files into the columns as specified by the bind variables
referenced.
<br><br>

<li>ns_ora clob_get_file <i>dbhandle sql path</i>
<li>ns_ora blob_get_file <i>dbhandle sql path</i><br>
Evaluates the given sql statement (which should return just one column
from one row) and writes the value to the specified file.  (any previous
file contents will be replaced by the new value)  The caller is
responsible for deleting the file.
<br><br>

<li>ns_ora write_clob <i>dbhandle sql ?nbytes?</i>
<li>ns_ora write_blob <i>dbhandle sql ?nbytes?</i><br>
Evaluates the given sql statement (which should return just one column
from one row) and returns the value to the connection.  You can
specify the number of bytes to be returned in the nbytes argument.  By
default the entire BLOB/CLOB is returned.
<br><br>
    
<li>ns_ora select <i>dbhandle sql ?arg1 ... argn?</i>
<li>ns_ora 0or1row <i>dbhandle sql ?arg1 ... argn?</i>
<li>ns_ora 1row <i>dbhandle sql ?arg1 ... argn?</i>
<li>ns_ora dml <i>dbhandle sql ?arg1 ... argn?</i>
<li>ns_ora array_dml <i>dbhandle sql ?arg1 ... argn?</i>
<li>ns_ora clob_dml_bind <i>dbhandle sql list_of_lob_vars ?clob_value_1 clob_value_2 ... clob_value_N?</i>
<li>ns_ora blob_dml_bind <i>dbhandle sql list_of_lob_vars ?clob_value_1 clob_value_2 ... clob_value_N?</i>
<li>ns_ora clob_dml_file_bind <i>dbhandle sql list_of_lob_vars ?clob_value_1 clob_value_2 ... clob_value_N?</i>
<li>ns_ora blob_dml_file_bind <i>dbhandle sql list_of_lob_vars ?clob_value_1 clob_value_2 ... clob_value_N?</i>
<li>ns_ora exec_plsql_bind <i>dbhandle sql return_var ?arg1 ... argn?</i><br>
These are described above under the <b>Bind Variables</b> section.
</ul>

<h3>Does it work with 7.3?</h3>

Depends what you mean by "work".  We don't have any production
AOLserver/Oracle 7.3 systems live on the Web.  By our definition, "work"
means "publicly accessible on the Internet and handling at least 10
hits/second".  So we can't guarantee that you will download a tar file
from us and be happy without editing the C code.  In fact, Oracle
completely changed their C interface between Release 7 and 8.  So you
can't just take our latest Oracle 8 driver and win.  Anyway, if you're a
C wizard you can probably make our driver work in a day.  If you're not,
hire a C wizard!  If you can't hack C and you're too poor to pay a C
wizard, then you probably should be running Solid (see <a
href="http://demo.webho.com">http://demo.webho.com</a>) instead of
Oracle.

<h3>Weird stuff to remember</h3>
</a>

Make sure to set the AOLserver StackSize parameter to something
reasonable, e.g., 500000, if you're using our driver and any recursion
in Tcl.  The installation instruction page for the ArsDigita Community
System covers this.  Basically the problem is that AOLserver only
allocates a stack by default of 50,000 bytes.  Cotton Seed wrote the
driver initially to stack-allocate 40,000 bytes to handle error
messages.  I guess this is how C programmers deal with the fact that
they don't have a real computer language like Lisp that can allocate
appropriate-sized data structures on the fly.  Anyway, that only leaves
10,000 bytes for Tcl recursion, which might not be enough.  Here's an
example of bumping up the stack size:

<blockquote>
<pre>
[ns/parameters]
User=nsadmin
Home=/home/nsadmin
StackSize=500000
</pre>

</blockquote>

There are also a number of moving pieces in the AOLserver database 
configuration.  The one that seems to give folks the most trouble
is the DataSource parameter in the pool configuration.  It should look
something like this:

<blockquote>
<code>
[ns/db/pool/poolname]<br>
Driver=ora8<br>
Connections=4<br>
<b>DataSource=</b><br>
User=alex<br>
Password=woofwoof<br>
Verbose=On<br>
ExtendedTableInfo=On<br>
</code>
</blockquote>

DataSource must be included, and it should be blank.  You may want
to take a peek at a <a href="sample-db-ini.txt">sample database
configuration</a> section.

<p>

Be sure to set your Oracle environment variables.  Take a look
at our <a href="sample-nsd-oracle.txt">sample AOLserver/Oracle
startup script</a>

<p>

If you're wanting to run AOLserver on one machine and Oracle on
another, then check out <a
href="http://photo.net/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg.tcl?msg_id=000SNv">
this thread</a> on photo.net.  We don't use this configuration
ourselves so we haven't tested it.

<p>

We have encountered error ORA-24812 when reading CLOBs containing UTF-8
data from the database.  Increasing the chunk size that the driver uses to
read the LOBs helps avoid the problem.  The default size is 16K.  You
can set the size in bytes of the LOB buffer by adding something like
this to your config file:

<blockquote><pre>[ns/db/driver/ora8]
LOBBufferSize=200000</pre></blockquote>

Assuming you loaded the driver using the name "ora8", this makes the
driver will use a buffer size of 200000 bytes.

<p>

If you encounter error ORA-01406, "fetched column value was truncated",
you need to use the CharExpansion parameter:

<blockquote><pre>[ns/db/driver/ora8]
CharExpansion=2</pre></blockquote>

This will make the driver allocate twice as much space for char and
varchar columns.

<a name="Oracle8i">
<h3>HPUX11 and Oracle 8.1.5</h3>
</a>

<p>

There is a problem with this driver under HPUX11 with Oracle 8.1.5
(8i). The Oracle driver must link against libclntsh.sl, the Oracle
shared client library. This library links against libcl and
libpthread, which contain "thread local storage". As documented in the
man page for shl_load(), libraries containing thread local storage
cannot be loaded using shl_load().

<p>

The workaround is to generate a version of libclntsh.sl without libcl
and libpthread, and cause the Oracle driver to link against that.

<p>

<a href="hp11-oracle815-driver-2.0.tar.gz">Here</a> is a binary
version of the 2.0 Oracle driver and libclntsh.sl compiled on HPUX 11
with Oracle 8.1.5 and AOLserver 2.3.3 for
HPUX11. Place the files in the bin directory into your AOLserver's bin
directory and read the README.txt file for instructions on how to
use, and how to generate your own version of these files if necessary.

         columns over 1024 bytes are not supported.
    <li> Fixed complaint when inserting an empty string via clob_dml.  It now
         inserts a NULL value in this case
    <li> Added clob_dml_file and clob_get_file commands
    <li> Added write_clob command
    <li> Added blob versions of all of the clob commands
    <li> Added safety features for 
         <a href="http://arsdigita.com/free-tools/cassandracle.html">
         Cassandracle</a>
    <li> Added the debug configuration parameter, so now getting trace
         output doesn't require recompiling the driver
    <li> clob_dml SQL and the CLOB contents are now logged to the server.log
         when verbose=on is set in the pool's configuration
    <li> Rewrote makefiles so the same makefile works on Solaris, HP-UX 11.00,
         and Linux
  </ul>

<p> <li> 1.0.1: Released April 5, 1999.  Fixed clob_get_file so it won't leak open
     files.  (fix donated by Igor Baikalov - thanks!)

<p> <li> 1.0.2: Released April 14, 1999.  Added display of Oracle's warning
     messages when a result code of OCI_SUCCESS_WITH_INFO is returned (which
     can happen in cases such as having NULL values in aggregate functions)

<p> <li> 1.0.3: Released June 11, 1999.  Turned OCI_SUCCESS_WITH_INFO
    into a non-error condition.  Oracle changed behavior between 8.0.X and
    8.1.X, causing the use of aggregate functions with NULLs to generate a
    warning.  Since NULLs in aggregates usually aren't a problem, we
    recommend upgrading to this version from 1.0.2

<p> <li> 2.0: Released January 6, 2000
  <ul>
      <li> Fixed error where *lob_get_file would leave temporary files in /var/tmp.
      <li> Optimized *lob_get_file to return directly to the connection rather than
        spooling from the file system.
      <li> It's now easier to see what version of the driver you are running.
        Perform a "strings ora8.so | grep ArsDigita" to get the version number.
      <li> Fixed ora_open_db to return a better error than "NULL Connection" if
        it fails to connect to Oracle.
      <li> Fixed a number of errors found by Jin Choi (jsc@arsdigita.com)
      <li> Added cleanup if the oracle process dies unexpectedly (which would
        ultimately lead to the "hostdef extension doesn't exist" error.
      <li> Added cleanup of the oracle process if a "too many oracle processes"
        (ORA-00020) or "oracle not available" (ORA-01034) error occurs.
      <li> Added in reimplementations of some functions that were removed from
        AOLserver 3.0 but are needed by ACS.
      <li> The oracle 8.1.X makefile is now the default makefile.  If you're
        still using Oracle 8.0.X, you'll need to use the makefile-80:
        gmake -f makefile-80
  </ul>

<p> <li> 2.0.1: Release January 14, 2000
  <ul>
       <li> Fixed linking problem on Linux.<br>
            (if you get an "undefined symbol <i>fstat</i>" error when
            loading the driver, you need this version)
           
  </ul>
<p> <li> 2.1: Release May 1, 2000
    <ul>
      <li> Plugged some potential buffer overflow situations when reporting
       errors.
      <li> Added bind variable support.
      <li> The error message for certain SQL errors now indicates the
      location in the SQL of the error. (contributed by H.B. Weinberg)
      <li> You can now use ns_dberrorcode to get the numeric Oracle
      error code after an error.
      <li> We no longer put huge arrays on the stack, so you shouldn't
      need to turn up your AOLserver stack size so much any more.
      <li>Fixed some memory-allocation problems in bind variable support (we were
          not calling <tt>Ns_StrDup</tt> in all the right places).
      <li> Expanded bind-variable support.
      <li> Added array DML.
      <li> Fixed bug when reading partial LOBs.
      <li> Added support for building on Win32 platforms.
    </ul>
<p> <li> 2.2: Release July 28, 2000
    <ul>
      <li> Fixed a problem with EPIPE handling in stream_write_lob.
      (Contributed by Paul Laferriere.)
      <li> Fixed a problem with handling UTF-8 data in LOBs.
      (Contributed by Jin Choi.)
      <li>Added clob_dml_bind, clob_dml_file_bind, blob_dml_bind,
      blob_dml_file_bind, exec_plsql_bind functions.
    </ul>

<p> <li> 2.3: Release 2000-09-11
    <ul>
	<li> New Makefile based on AOLserver 3 Makefiles.
	<li> Beginnings of a code reorganization.
	<li> Eliminated a tiny memory leak in the [bc]lob_dml* commands.
    </ul>

<p> <li> 2.4: Release 2000-10-12
    <ul>
	<li> Make LOB buffer size a configuration parameter so we can
	    work around mysterious ORA-24812 bug.  Set parameter
	    LobBufferSize in ns/db/driver/ora to the desired buffer
	    size.
    </ul>

<p> <li> 2.5: Release 2001-01-17
    <ul>
        <li> Fix spurious frees in exec_plsql_bind when there were
          undefined bind varaibles.
        <li> Fix frees lob_dml_bind_cmd which should have freed lob_argv
          rather than argv.
        <li> Fix free of fetchbuf->array_values (should use Tcl_Free when 
          allocation is by Tcl_SplitList).
        <li> Added support for oracle LONGs of greater than 1024 bytes.
        <li> Added support for setting prefetchrows and prefetchmemory
          to improve throughput on nonlocal oracle connections.  To use
          set parameter PrefetchMemory (in bytes) and/or PrefetchRows in 
          ns/db/driver/ora.
    </ul> 

<p> <li> 2.6: Release TBA
    <ul>
	<li> Fix buffer size for RAW columns.  Thanks Mike Linksvayer
	&lt;ml@gondwanaland.com&gt;.
	<li> Added CharExpansion parameter.  Thanks Tomasz Kosiak
	&lt;tkosiak@arena.pl&gt;.
    </ul>
